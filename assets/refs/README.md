# Project1 - Nutrition Pal


**USER STORY**

AS A person that's concerned with my own health, fitness, and longevity...
I WANT to know whether what I'm eating each day is adequate and nutritious enough...
SO THAT I can confirm or change my diet choices in support of a healthy, intentional lifestyle...

**DESCRIPTION**

The idea is to have an app that allows a person to input the foods they have eaten each day along with other personal criteria and submit.  Then, the app will use this input to query APIs and collect nutritional information about the foods eaten.  The app will compare the nutrition intake to established general daily intake values and then recommend food/recipe choices based on nutrients that are lacking. 

EXTRAS: 
- expand initial UDSA search into comma separated links for additional variations of searched food item
- switch to using a different API if default API fails to provide result
- compile and store a digest of current day's input (key metrics as percent with top three areas for improvement) and display as history
